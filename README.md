Python Behaviour Tree for game AI action selection

This is a basic implementation of a Behaviour Tree in python
for Game AI action selection. It is a WIP but is functional
and can be run via test.py to see an example of action
selection

# TODO:
* More Node types; Succeeders, Concurrent, Wait, Random select (Weighted)
* Proper implementation of context passing between nodes
* Passing context values to action functions
* Long running, multi-tick actions
